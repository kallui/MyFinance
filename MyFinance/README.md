# MyFinance

## An application that keeps track of the user's spendings

**MyFinance** is an application that users can use to keep track of their
total spending, and to see a summary of their spendings. It is the perfect
application for those who are having trouble keeping track of their total 
spendings, and to those that want to see a quick overview or the highlights 
of their spendings. 

I decided to make **MyFinance** because I personally believe this is an application that I need
in my life because I can sometimes have trouble keeping track of how much money I have
spent, and I'm sure there are some people out there that need this app in their life too!

- I could possibly divide AppGUI into smaller classes, so it's easier to read.
